# Practice Problems - Code Solutions #

## A Work-In-Progress of Various Practice Problems ##

### Introduction: ###

These are my solutions to various practice problems as well as example code segments. Each problem has been labeled with the corresponding information problem in the comments. 

* Codeforces problems can be found at [Codeforces](www.codeforces.com).
* Cracking the Code problems can be found in the Cracking the Coding Interview book.
* Scratchwork contains various example code, such as data structures and algorithms.

### Usage: ###

When a Makefile has been included, you can do the following:

Run `make <name>` to compile the problem you want to run.

After compiling, you can run the file with `./<name> [args]`

Run `make clean` to clean the directory.

### Notes ###
This is a work in progress. Not all solutions are the best possible, but I hope to improve as I learn better code practice. I will try to post only working solutions. Whatever I post is free to view and use, but I recommend attempting the problem first before looking at my code. Please let me know if you use any code here!

Thanks to [Tony Ho](https://github.com/tonyho1992) for introducing me to Codeforces.
