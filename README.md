# Codeforces Solutions #

## A Work-In-Progress of Codeforces Solutions ##

### Saagar Deshpande ###

### Introduction: ###

These are my solutions to various Codeforces problems.
Each problem has been labeled with the corresponding codeforces problem.

All problems can be found at [Codeforces](www.codeforces.com).

### Usage: ###
Run `make <name>` to compile the problem you want to see.

After compiling, you can run the file with `./<name> [args]`

Run `make clean` to clean the directory.

### Notes ###
This is a work in progress. Not all solutions are the best possible, as I learn better code practice. I will try to post only working solutions. Whatever I post is free to view and use, but I recommend attempting the problem first before looking at my code.

Thanks to [Tony Ho](https://github.com/tonyho1992) for introducing me to Codeforces.
